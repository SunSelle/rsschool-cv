I graduated from the Kyev school of photography.
Also Studied Japanese and Serbian languages.

## English
I think my level of English is *Intermediate*. I can read texts, but it’s hard for me to speak fluent. Because I'm confused about times and have not rich lexicon. I can understand speaking language if interlocutor doesn’t speak very fast.
